    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A dish consisting of beaten eggs, often folded over other ingredients such as cheese.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 eggs</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon milk</li>
        <li>salt to taste</li>
        <li>freshly ground white pepper to taste</li>
        <li>2 tbsp butter</li>
        <li>1/4 cup shredded Emmentaler (or other) cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Beat eggs in a bowl with a whisk. Add milk and season with salt and white pepper.<br>Whisk for a few minutes until egg mixture is foamy; beating in air makes the omelette fluffy.</li>
        <li>Melt butter in a small, nonstick skillet over medium-low heat. <br> Pour in egg mixture and twirl skillet so bottom is evenly covered with egg. <br> Cook for 1 minute until egg starts to set. Lift edges with a spatula and tilt the skillet so uncooked egg mixture can run towards the bottom of the skillet to set. <br>Repeat until no visible liquid egg remains.</li>
        <li>Carefully flip omelette and cook for another 30 seconds to 1 minute. <br>Sprinkle Emmentaler cheese in one line in the middle of the omelette and fold omelette in half. Cook for 20 seconds, then slide omelette onto plate.</li>
    </ol>
